         <h2>IOI & REQUIREMENTS</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>What are the requirements to join Apostles of the Abyss?
               <ul>
                  <li>We’re looking for players that are motivated and driven You should be planning to play & be active within our community
                  by launch time at least 4 evenings a week during our Prime-Time. You must have a headset to listen in for team
                  communication via Discord. Mic required only for leadership & officer roles, but strongly requested.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Will your guild be active in the Alpha/Beta tests?
               <ul>
                  <li>There are a couple of members with Alpha-1 access, few members that will have Alpha-2 access, and a decent amount of our
                  members will have beta access. While access is not required to join, we are hoping to have 40-60%/+ of our members
                  active in the beta. We will also have several people dedicated to streaming Alpha / Beta for our members to watch &
                  learn from.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Will we be active before the release of Ashes of Creation?
               <ul>
                  <li>Yes, keep reading. But also ~ We don’t want to just be a reservation spot for you, although we can be. But we want you
                  to be invested in reserving your spot and playing to grow with us. If we have synergy on launch, we will dominate.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>What will be our most active time of day?
               <ul>
                  <li>6 PM until 12 ~ 1 A.M. Sunday - Thursday & 5 PM until 2 A.M. Friday & Saturday</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>What activity will get me kicked or suspended?
               <ul>
                  <li>Being inactive for over 30 days with no notice or reasonable explanation. Being blatantly awful to another Guild-mate
                  based on case. Exploiting / using any cheats in an MMO environment. Leaking of private information to outside sources.
                  Streaming during vulnerable events without leadership permission. Streaming without guild-mate notice or permission to
                  be included.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Is your community currently playing any games together before AoC launches?
               <ul>
                  <li>While we wait on Ashes of Creation, strategy... Playing with us in key titles we organize should be indicative of how we
                  will operate in Ashes of Creation~ Helping others, creating guides & FAQ's frequently updated, indexes for helping you
                  succeed faster, and working together to move forward. We felt Final Fantasy XI promoted many of Ashes of Creation’s key
                  qualities requiring cooperation with others within its own mechanics. Serpico & Kino will co-head the open-invite
                  (probably Saturday) nights in/after October for Star Wars: Squadrons. He'll also be the leader of the Last Epoch
                  Division. There are a couple others active if you're interested in trying out Black Desert, or a few people enjoying
                  Deep Rock Galactic together if you'd like to drink beer and mine in space as dwarves fighting off bastardly spider and
                  insectoid alien things.</li>

         <h2>GUILD AMBITION</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>What style of community are you trying to build?
               <ul>
                  <li>We are trying build a relatively sizeable community of all types of players: Casual, Hardcore, pvp players, pve players,
                  ect. Regardless of how you want to play the game, we'd be more than happy to have you participate in the community. That
                  said, we will host both a mid-core / laid back - as well as a progression set of Raiders, a highly organized system of
                  internal Bounty Hunters, and we have large ambitions for the game.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>What size of guild will this be?
               <ul>
                  <li>We aim to host the maximum of 300, with the possibility of further expansion.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Will you be playing competitively?
               <ul>
                  <li>We intend to be a Metropolis major Patron Guild. In addition, our Guild will be rolling out our expansion plans
                  establishing ourselves as a major presence in the realm we settle on. We will host a progression-style raiding team, and
                  our interior Bounty Hunters will be adept warriors dedicated to the cause.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Has there been any thought put into Alliances?
               <ul>
                  <li>Yes. We will be reserving 2 Alliance spots for internal use, and the remaining 3 will be quite carefully considered. 1
                  Will be held for another Large / Patron Guild, the remaining 2 will be held for honorable Vassal Guilds.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>INTERIOR FACTIONS</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Will this guild be following a specific religion or is there religious freedom?
               <ul>
                  <li>We do not know enough about the Religion system yet and its potential to answer this question right now.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Will there be a limit on certain artisans?
               <ul>
                  <li>There's two classes in this category: Guild Artisans, And Masters. We'll take as many varied masters as we can get. As
                  for Guild Artisans, there may only be 1-3 per trade pending our needs or as we learn more information. Ship-building for
                  example will be restricted to 1 Guild Artisan, and he will coordinate with our Treasurer and other Artisans as required.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>How involved will life-skill players be?
               <ul>
                  <li>Extremely. We plan to organize a system with our central and eventual chain of Taverns so Chefs will have a major retail
                  space for stocking product Our Gatherers, Processors, & Smelters will be busy at every turn from Upgrading our node,
                  Building our homes, Gearing our Raiders & Siegers, Makin toast. Our Contract system will allow an Alchemist to set up a
                  regular shop and list prices to build a regular customer-base (just 1 example)</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>How involved will Bounty Hunter / PvP players be?
               <ul>
                  <li>Ridiculous levels of involvement. These players will work with our Falcon of Light (PvP Captain, his sub-officers, & our
                  Treasurer - as we: Arrange contracts internally and externally for asset protection. Our Contract system that will be
                  available to allies - will host options for: One-time, or duration-based route protection, Specialty-Escorts, Groups of
                  Rogues or other arrangements that will focus on strategic levels of play & disruption, Rich-vein escort & protection for
                  gathering professionals.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>

      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>RAIDING</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>What is our raiding mentality?
               <ul>
                  <li>We will host at least both 1 Progression / Semi~HC Raid & 1 Mid-Core / Laid-back-but-focused Raid. We don’t like the
                  word Casual. While we understand its meaning, it is too often used as a sleight or insult within the community.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>When will our Raid Schedule be announced?
               <ul>
                  <li>Closer to Beta 1. Mid-Core players can expect one raid night to fall on Saturday evenings.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>What is our approach to Raid Leadership?
               <ul>
                  <li>Raid Leadership should be a team-mentality. 1~2 Raid Leaders, Dungeon Masters, & Class Leaders will all be attached to
                  each Raiding team. This team will ensure fair practices are in place, our time is used wisely, & loot is distributed
                  fairly.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>What is our loot policy?
               <ul>
                  <li>For 16 & 40-person content, some form of Dragon Kill Points (DKP) will be used. For our progression-raid, an integrated
                  / hybrid DKP + Loot Council will be used so that loot is distributed fairly. Just as one example: For progression
                  raiding, it will be important the upgrades go to the right people, such as prioritizing someone with regular attendance
                  where the upgrade would be a 20% overall improvement compared to both a brand new member to the raid as well as someone
                  to whom it would be a 5% increase. Our exact DKP ruleset will be chosen & refined closer to Beta 1 & scheduling
                  announcements.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>NODE AMBITION</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Have we decided on a node type?
               <ul>
                  <li>Sort-of, but this is internal information. I also say sort-of in that we’ve narrowed it down. Keep reading to understand
                  why.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Aren’t snowy mountains awesome?
               <ul>
                  <li>Yes… Yes.. they are. We love them. So many people do. To that end, we want to deliberately avoid this and are
                  comfortable making that one part known. We want individuals seeking a unique adventure together as a Guild destined for
                  profit, regardless of terrain.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Will we offer major perks to Guild Members or Allied Guilds?
               <ul>
                  <li>Quite a few one-of a kind perk/s. We are developing a web-based Contract Board for matching Guild Members with Artisans
                  & Bounty Hunters in our internal ‘Band of the Falcon’ Guild led by our Falcon of Light. The Falcon & his 2
                  Shield~Officers will handle transactions as well as coordinate with Treasurer Jade. Players interested in frequent /
                  active Player-vs-Player activities will want to be allied with our Band of the Hawk faction ~ as they will be leading
                  elite teams for Caravan protection, Siege special-forces for offense & defense, & will coordinate with our War Council
                  for strategy preparation. Guild Members will have post-access to this Contract Board to establish shops, list prices for
                  services rendered, etc. Allied Guilds in those coveted 3 slots will possibly be granted code access to a buyer’s view of
                  our Contract Board and establish service contracts with our Hunters or Artisans. This will be based on trust between our
                  diplomats & leadership.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>LAUNCH PLANS</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Why are we being so secretive?
               <ul>
                  <li>Because we don’t want others to interfere with our plans, just as we aren’t scheming against anyone else. There is also
                  just so much we’re still learning about the game, and things we just don’t know yet. It’s difficult to fully develop
                  ideas until a more complete database exists for a knowledge-base.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Have we decided on a node area / cluster?
               <ul>
                  <li>Same as above answer, these talks will remain private, but to expand on these issues as you’ll continue to see ~ We want
                  to run a diplomatic economy. In that respect, we are occasionally running polls to gauge what the majority of our
                  players are interested in and building some discussions based on those results. To get best, most accurate results, we
                  want to push for 125 ~ 150/+ and run a few key polls, have a couple of targeted discussions, & make some decisions
                  together.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Will we be streaming anything?
               <ul>
                  <li>We have several members that will be streaming parts of Alpha, Beta, & launch. We have an official 
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/AbyssApostles">Twitter</a> & <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/apostlesoftheabyss">Twitch</a></li>
